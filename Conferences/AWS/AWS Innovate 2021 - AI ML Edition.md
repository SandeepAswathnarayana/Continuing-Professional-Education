## Prepare your Datasets at Scale using Apache Spark and SageMaker Data Wrangler - Chris Fregly, AWS Senior Advocate, AI/ML  
- Use Apache Spark when using large datasets (Pands, Scikit-learn do not scale to large datasets)  
- Check data quality with AWS Deequ python library and SageMaker Processing Jobs  
- Data Wrangler: Transform 5-star rating to Sentimental (Negative, Neutral, Positive). Steps: (1) Ingest the data using Athena (2) Data types (3) Process numeric (Min-Max Scaler)  
- Bias during Feature Engineering: choose metrics from the options given below.  
- Feature importance: Importance vs Features graph  
- Data Wrangler Feature Store Noteebook  
- Train Apache SparkML models using SageMaker Processing Jobs: Ex - Movie Recommendations
